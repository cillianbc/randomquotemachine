# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Unit Project #3: Page Speed Dashboard

For my final project I choose Google's Page Speed Insights API to allow me to check the speed score of a given website from both a mobile and desktop perspective.
I can then add the recomendations given to a to-do list so I can take action on it.



## Whats Next

* Wan't to make the do todo list Website specific
* Wan't to allow user login and then let them track multiple websites over time
* Incorporate more page speed checks from different API sources. MOZ, GTMETRIX,Yslow from Yahoo,majestic
